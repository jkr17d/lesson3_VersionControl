            <p class="lead">What is “version control”, and why would you care? Version control is a system that records alterations to a file or set of files over time so that you can recollect specific versions later. Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they’re clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to. To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout, a VCS is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to reopen selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, equate changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who initiated an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also normally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover.</p>

            <p class="lead">A repository is like a folder for your project. Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's revision history. You can own a repository individually, and give other people collaborator access to your repository so that they can collaborate on your project. You can also share ownership of a repository with other people in an organization, and give organization members access permissions to collaborate on your repository. Repositories can be public or private. Public repositories are visible to everyone. Only the owner and collaborators can view or contribute to a private repository.

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Even though Git’s interface is similar to other VCSs, Git stores and thinks about information in a different way, and understanding these differences will help you avoid becoming confused while using it. The major difference between Git and any other VCS is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These other systems think of the information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over. Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots. Every time you save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Some examples are Git commands are;
Workflow: your local repository consists of three "trees" maintained by git. The first one is your Working Directory which holds the actual files. The second one is the Index which acts as a staging area and finally the HEAD which points to the last commit you've made.
Git init: This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. This is the first step in creating a repository. After running git init, adding and committing files/directories is possible.
